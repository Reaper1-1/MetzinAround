# This space constantly under construction (and likely full of typos)
"Why?", you ask? Becasue I teach people how to make their first repo, new branch, and pull request using the Profile README, and thus am constantly making changes to my own profile to explain these concepts! 

## Pj, you can just use a different repo and keep a nice, clean, professional README on your GitHub Profile. Afterall, don't you work for GitHub? 

Indeed, dear reader. I do work for GitHub. And perhaps a nice clean professional README is something a professional person should have. But using my own profile emphasizes the real world effects of making changes to your main repo and lets me have a little fun. Like how the picture coming up will change every time I do this exercise, so visistors to my profile will never know what they're gonna get.

Wow that picture was wild. Good job, Pj. 

## Alright, point made. Have fun with it, I guess?

There's no other way, my friend.
